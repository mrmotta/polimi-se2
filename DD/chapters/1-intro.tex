\chapter{Introduction} \label{introduction}

Nowadays, electric vehicles are becoming very popular. The need to reduce pollution to save our planet is compelling, and anything we can do to reduce the effects of climate change is moving towards the use of clean energy sources, and everyone can do their part.\medskip

Many people are changing their cars to electric ones, and in many cities charging stations are being installed for these vehicles. The main aim of the \textsc{eMall} project is to limit the carbon footprint of our mobility by making easy and efficient charging electric cars, focusing on planning the charge.\medskip

The \textsc{eMall} project also focuses on the energy needed to accomplish charging cars, as it's important to manage it most efficiently. This is done to reduce the cost of the primary resources and to make the service even more competitive and cheap. The \textsc{eMall} project tries to simplify also this aspect of the charge chain.

\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to provide a general, complete, high-level view of the eMSP and CPMS systems, and of their interactions.\medskip

This document comprehends:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The architectural design of the two systems, comprehending various views over components and interfaces of the systems, and connections between them and between external systems. All these components are also viewed dynamically through the use of use-case sequence diagrams.
    \item A rough idea of what the users will experience in the means of user interfaces.
    \item The mapping between the systems' components and the requirements identified in the \textit{Requirements Analysis and Specification Document}.
    \item A plan on how the two systems should be implemented, integrated, and tested.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}

\paragraph{eMSP | Simplify the charging process of electric vehicles} Charging an electric vehicle can be a challenging task to do. Nowadays, it's not so easy to find charging stations where to plug the vehicle. So, also looking at the future where this kind of station will be more present in the territory, it's fundamental to have a system like this one to carefully plan the charge of the vehicle, in order to minimize the time spent on this task, so that it doesn't have any impact on drivers' lives. Thanks to this system it's possible to search for a charging station nearby, check prices and sales, and, of course, book a charging slot for the vehicle.

\paragraph{CPMS | Optimize the energy usage and supply} To be competitive, it's also important to minimize the costs of the whole infrastructure, paying careful attention to the price of the electricity and to the mix of primary sources from which it was derived. On the market, there are possibly many DSOs, each one with different supply capabilities, prices, and energy mixes. Choosing from which source to buy the energy is crucial, especially if the CPO can store it in batteries at the charging station.

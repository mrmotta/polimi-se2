\chapter{Specific Requirements} \label{requirements}

\section{External interface requirements}

\subsection{User interfaces}

\paragraph{eMSP} The system should be available to the end users in form of a web page and an accessible mobile application (which will be able to receive in-app notifications). In both cases, the user has to be connected to the internet.

\paragraph{CPMS} The system should be available to the end users in form of a web page. The ease of use is not of the outermost importance, and it's not to be preferred over a more complete and condensed view. Priority should be given to offering all functionalities in the quickest possible way and showing relevant information in the clearest way. Users are required to know how to use the system to fully be able to operate all functionalities (this can be done through the design of a user manual).

\subsection{Hardware interfaces}

\paragraph{eMSP} The eMSP doesn't have any particular hardware constraint, but its frontends should be run on any mobile device and computer (in this case only through a browser). Its backend only needs servers able to respond to the user's queries.

\paragraph{CPMS} The only hardware interface needed to access the CPMS is a computer with an installed browser since all functionalities are being offered through a website.

\subsection{Software interfaces}

\paragraph{APIs} The communication between the different systems should happen thanks to the use of standard APIs. All the systems described in this document should be also able to communicate with external systems which expose the same APIs.

\paragraph{eRoaming} There exists an eRoaming service that is accessible thanks to an API that allows eMSPs to query about available CPOs and their location. It also provides the eMSP with the endpoint address of every selected CPMS (CPO's backend).

\paragraph{OpenStreetMap} The eMSP application uses the OpenStreetMap API to provide the map of all the connected charging stations of the various CPOs.

\subsection{Use cases}

Every time \doublequotes{consumer} or \doublequotes{user} appears in a UML diagram, it's intended that s/he is interacting with the application or web page that interacts with the system.\medskip

For the sake of simplicity, many data checks and the opening of the application or web page, according to the use case, are not illustrated, but they are present in the system. Moreover, some cases are not depicted here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Notification preference}: the user is asked to choose between in-app notifications or email ones after his first login. Furthermore, the user can change this preference at any time under his/her profile.
    \item \textit{Logout}: simply removes the token\footnote{An explanation of the usage of the token can be found in the eMSP's login use case (\refUC{uc:e:login}).} from the client.
    \item \textit{Password change}: it works like most of the password changes implemented nowadays. The first option is that the user clicks on the \doublequotes{Forgot password?} link, receives an email with the link for changing it, and changes the password. The second one is that s/he goes to the user's details page and changes the password directly from there. In both cases, s/he has to log back in on all his/her connected devices.
\end{itemize}
Also, even if it's not specified in the diagrams, if any component fails, the user is notified and the action is automatically aborted, reverting its state to the original one. The same happens in case of user's network failures (which are \doublequotes{detected}\footnote{This is a simplification, since in a distributed environment with possible byzantine failures things are a bit more complex.} through a timeout).

Please, note that the token present in the scheme is to be intended like a JWT with all the information of the user (which can fit into the token because of their small size) that has to be sent every time. This explains why certain pieces of information are not queried every time they are needed.

Similar to this, the in-loco payment requires the user to insert his/her payment data (or to use a payment card, according to how it's implemented) and in this case it's the CPMS who notifies the eMSP, and not the other way round.

As stated in requirement \refR{r:c:periodical_updates}, the system periodically has to update the database with information regarding all changing parameters coming from charging stations. These include the station's battery levels, incoming energy from the solar panels, occupied columns in the station, and eventually more data. This allows the view controller to simply fetch data from the database, instead of intercepting all data streams, to communicate to the website in the corresponding views.

If the system is directly interfacing with the user and the response isn't available after a couple of seconds, the frontend should display a loading indicator. A lower waiting time can be archived thanks to a proper database configuration and through the redundancy of components and data. The application performs much of the required computations on the backend, thus letting the application and the web interface only display the contents and doing some basic operations (sorting, checks\dots).

\paragraph{CPMS} Since the CPMS system is more geared towards monitoring, and eventually allows for some actions from the user, availability should be preferred over reliability. It's not essential that the system does not crush (although it is preferred), since all changes are immediately saved in permanent storage. It's more important that if the system crushes it can recover quickly, and all inputs are delivered as soon as possible and made permanent in the database storage. All the computation will take place on the servers of the system, which have to be replicated and distributed to better assert the desired availability and reach a consensus over the input received.

\section{Design constraints}

\subsection{Standards compliance}

Every system should correctly implement all the needed standard APIs for allowing interconnection with different pieces of software that expose those functionalities. Moreover, each system should be compliant with common payment APIs for managing user payments.

\subsection{Hardware limitations} \label{hwlimitations}

\paragraph{eMSP} For accessing the system, the user can use both the application which should be available in all the main mobile stores and should run on most of the devices present nowadays (e.g. an Android version greater or equal to 4.4 KitKat) or a browser which supports at least ES6 for correctly displaying all the views of the website.

\paragraph{CPMS} For accessing the system, any computer/laptop/tablet/phone with an installed web browser, connected to the internet, is sufficient, as a website is the sole user access point.

\section{Software system attributes}

\subsection{Reliability}

\paragraph{eMSP} The eMSP should be reliable, and even in case of failures, it should recover quickly. If downtimes, even if small, are frequent, this might make the user experience painful because of probably many failed requests.

\paragraph{CPMS} The CPMS website should be reliable enough to let users monitor and perform actions. Reliability is not to be preferred over availability. The CPMS servers on the other hand can be replicated to allow for higher reliability and protection of the data.

\subsection{Availability}

\paragraph{eMSP} The eMSP should be available 99\% of the time (about 361 days per year). Any longer unavailability period might encourage the user to move to some other competitor.

\paragraph{CPMS} The CPMS should be available 99.7\% of the time (about 364 days per year). Such a high availability is needed for the server to be responsive toward all end users, for better monitoring, and to secure that input actions are almost always registered.

\subsection{Security}

\paragraph{eMSP} The eMSP should provide a high level of security for the information the users insert. Especially, the system must protect all the uploaded vehicles' information.

\paragraph{CPMS} The CPMS should provide a high level of security for the information the charging station dispatches. In particular, the system needs to be aware of \doublequotes{man in the middle} attacks where information coming from the stations is tampered with, which would result in incorrect automatic choices and eventually wrong information dispatched to the eMSP. Attention also should be paid to securing charging columns from possible manumissions in the validation of cars' certificates.

\subsection{Maintainability}

The system should follow basic design guidelines to make the whole system more maintainable. This will be described more deeply in the Design Document, but a general indication is to divide components into smaller ones, so that each one can do only a specific action, thus making the system easier to bring up and maintain, allowing also the maintenance of single components at a time.

\subsection{Portability}

\paragraph{eMSP} The backend should be able to run well on Linux systems, and it should be optimized to use all the standard Linux and POSIX features. The website should instead work well on all the major browsers, while the mobile application should be able to run on many architectures, allowing it to work on all the supported devices, as described in \reference{hwlimitations}.

\paragraph{CPMS} The backend should be able to run well on Linux systems, and it should be optimized to use all the standard Linux and POSIX features. The database system should be distributed for higher availability.
